### Hi there!

### Who am I

I am Dart and C developer, AOSP device trees developer.
Anyway I'm not very good at all sides, just a little at a time.

From the favourite of my projects I can remember:
* [MeizuSucks](https://github.com/meizucustoms) - custom sources for Meizu devices
* [True Man Radio](https://github.com/trueManRadio) - radio with Gachimuchi remixes written in Dart
